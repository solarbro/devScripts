# Development Scripts
This is a collection of scripts I find useful and use with all my projects.

**build.sh** is a bash script that wraps several other build scripts, and provides a unified interface for compiling, cleaning, and launching the project executable with either GCC or Clang, in debug or release configurations.
It uses a CMake build system set up by Jeffrey Uong.

**repo.sh** is a simplified wrapper around git which provides all the functions I commonly use, because I find it hard to remember how to do anything more complex than pull and push, from the terminal.

There are also some batch scripts that generate Visual Studio 2013/15 solutions.
